# Trading Data Analysis Scripts

This repository contains three Python scripts for analyzing and visualizing trading data. These scripts are designed for users with minimal coding experience and are meant to be run in a specific order.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, please ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- ib_insync library
- pandas library
- matplotlib library

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install ib_insync pandas matplotlib
```

## Script 1: buffer_main_script.py

This script retrieves tick data from a specified financial instrument using the Interactive Brokers API (ib_insync library). It saves the tick data to a CSV file for further analysis.

To run this script, follow these steps:

1. Open `buffer_main_script.py` in a text editor.
2. Locate the line `directory = 'ADD PATH'` and replace `'ADD PATH'` with the desired directory path where you want to save the tick data CSV files.
3. Adjust the `interval` variable if needed. It represents the time interval (in seconds) between each data retrieval.
4. Save the modifications and run the script.

## Script 2: buffer_compute_values.py

This script reads the most recent tick data CSV file generated by `buffer_main_script.py` and computes additional values based on the data. It saves the computed values to a new CSV file.

To run this script, follow these steps:

1. Open `buffer_compute_values.py` in a text editor.
2. Locate the line `DIRECTORY = "ADD PATH"` and replace `'ADD PATH'` with the directory path where the tick data CSV files are saved (the same directory used in `buffer_main_script.py`).
3. Adjust the `wait_time_seconds` variable if needed. It represents the time to wait (in seconds) between each computation.
4. Save the modifications and run the script.

## Script 3: buffer_plot_script.py

This script reads the most recent computed values CSV file generated by `buffer_compute_values.py` and plots the data using matplotlib. It provides an animated plot that updates every specified interval.

To run this script, follow these steps:

1. Open `buffer_plot_script.py` in a text editor.
2. Locate the line `files = glob.glob("/ADD PATH/computed_FDAX*.csv")` and replace `'/ADD PATH'` with the directory path where the computed values CSV files are saved (the same directory used in `buffer_compute_values.py`).
3. Adjust the `window_size` variable if needed. It represents the number of data points to display in the plot.
4. Save the modifications and run the script.

Note: Make sure to run the scripts in the given order to ensure proper data flow and functionality.
